This is a repo for the official front end for the Bowlicious Bowtique website. 
Maintained by MRP Technologies.

## About
This project is a faux E-commerce website that turned out to be my final project at Flatiron School. The purposes was to learn more about how React and the Redux library work together.

## Objectives
- Learn more about React and Redux
- Incorporate RESTful Routing
- Set communications between React (front-end) and Ruby on Rails (back-end API)

## Challenges encountered
- Redux was the most challenging to understand for this project. It creates a store and maintains all information at the top level of the application. Combating this gap in knowledge involved much trial and error in order to understand how to connect each component connected to the Redux store.

## Key Features
- RESTful Routing
- Back-end communication (Ruby on Rails)

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- Redux.js
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
